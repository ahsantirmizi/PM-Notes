IMPORTANT TERMS
Risk: An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives.

Risk response: it is the process of developing strategic options, and determining actions, to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to the project's objectives

Risk Acceptance: A Risk response strategy whereby the project team decides to acknowledge the Risk and not take any action unless the Risk occurs.

Risk Appetite:The degree of uncertainty an entity is willing to take on, in anticipation of a reward.

Residual risk: A risk that remains after risk responses have been implemented.

Risk Attitude:Risk attitudes are people's intentions to evaluate a Risk situation in a favorable or unfavorable way and to act accordingly.

Risk Breakdown Structure (rBS): A hierarchical representation of Risks according to their Risk categories.

Risk categorization: Organization by sources of Risk (e.g., using the RBS), the area of the project affected (e.g., using the WBS), or other useful category (e.g., project phase) to determine the areas of the project most exposed to the effects of uncertainty.

Risk category: A group of potential causes of Risk.

Risk data Quality Assessment: Technique to evaluate the degree to which the data about Risks is useful for Risk management.

Risk Management Plan: A component of the project, program, or portfolio management plan that describes how Risk management activities will be structured and performed.

Risk Mitigation: A Risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to reduce the probability of occurrence or impact of a Risk.

Risk reassessment: Risk reassessment is the identification of new Risks, reassessment of current Risks, and the closing of Risks that are outdated.

Risk register: A document in which the results of Risk analysis and Risk response planning are recorded.

Risk threshold: Measure of the level of uncertainty or the level of impact at which a stakeholder may have a specific interest: Below that Risk threshold, the organization will accept the Risk: Above that Risk threshold, the organization will not tolerate the Risk.

Risk tolerance: The degree, amount, or volume of Risk that an organization or individual will withstand.

Risk transference: A Risk response strategy whereby the project team shifts the impact of a threat to a third party, together with ownership of the response.

Risk urgency Assessment: Review and determination of the timing of actions that may need to occur sooner than other Risk items.


HOW ORGANIZATION ENVIRONMENT CONTRRIBUTES IN PROJECT RISK.
Risk conditions may include aspects of the project’s or organization’s environment that contribute to project risk, 

such as immature project management practices, 
lack of integrated management systems, 
concurrent multiple projects, or 
dependency on external participants who are outside the project’s direct control.


Known,known: Those risk that has being identified and managed proactively, planned response
Known,unknown: Those risk that has being identified but not managed proactively, there must be contingency reserve for that
Unknow,unknown: Those risk that has not being identified and not managed proactively, there must be Management Reserve

Positive and negative risks are commonly referred to as opportunities and threats

To be successful, an organization should be committed to address risk management proactively and consistently throughout the project

Perform Qualitative

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is the process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing and combining their probability of occurrence and impact. 

Benefit:

The key benefit of this process is that it enables project managers to reduce the level of uncertainty and to focus on high-priority risks.
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is usually a rapid and cost-effective means of establishing priorities for Plan Risk Responses
The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle

Tools & Techniques

 .1 Risk probability and impact assessment

	Risk impact assessment is the process of assessing the probabilities and consequences of risk events if they are realized. The results of this assessment are then used to prioritize risks to establish a most-to-least-critical importance ranking. Ranking risks in terms of their criticality or importance provides insights to the project's management on where resources may be needed to manage or mitigate the realization of high probability/high consequence risk events.

	Risk impact assessment investigates the potential effect on a project objective such as schedule, cost, quality, or performance
	Risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings
	

 .2 Probability and impact matrix

The risk score helps guide risk responses. For example, risks that have a negative impact on objectives, otherwise known as threats if they occur, and that are in the high-risk (dark gray) zone of the matrix, may require priority action and aggressive response strategies. Threats found in the low-risk (medium gray) zone may not 
require proactive management action beyond being placed in the risk register as part of the watch list or adding a contingency reserve. Similarly for opportunities, those in the high-risk (dark gray) zone, which may be obtained most easily and offer the greatest benefit, should be targeted first. Opportunities in the low-risk (medium gray) zone should be monitored.

 .3 Risk data quality assessment

Risk data quality assessment is a technique to evaluate the degree to which the data about risks is useful for risk management. 
It involves examining the degree to which the risk is understood and the accuracy, quality, reliability, and integrity of the data about the risk.
The use of low-quality risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis of little use to the project

 .4 Risk categorization
 .5 Risk urgency assessment

Risks requiring near-term responses may be considered more urgent to address. 
Indicators of priority may include probability of detecting the risk, time to affect a risk response, symptoms and warning signs, and the risk rating.

Peroform Qauntitative 

Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis is the process of numerically analyzing the effect of identified risks on overall project objectives. 

Benefit
The key benefit of this process is that it produces quantitative risk information to support decision making in order to reduce project uncertainty

Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis is performed on risks that have been prioritized by the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process

it may not be possible to execute the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process due to lack of sufficient data to develop appropriate models

The project manager should exercise expert judgment to determine the need for and the viability of quantitative risk analysis

Inputs
 .1 Risk management plan
 .2 Cost management plan
 .3 Schedule management plan
 .4 Risk register
 .5 Enterprise environmental  
  factors
 .6 Organizational process assets



Tools & Techniques
 .1 Data gathering and representation techniques

	Interviewing: use 3 point estimation 
	Probability distribution:
		Continous distribution:use in simulation and modeling
			Beta 
			TRIANGULAR distribution
		Discrete distribution


 .2 Quantitative risk analysis and modeling techniques

	Sensitivity Analysis:
		A sensitivity analysis is a technique used to determine how different values of an independent variable impact a particular dependent variable under a given set of assumptions.
		Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which risks have the most potential impact on the project. 
		It helps to understand how the variations in project’s objectives correlate with variations in different uncertainties

	Expected Monetory value
		EVM is a ballpark figure that shows how much money a plaintiff can reasonably expect in mediation
		Expected monetary value (EMV) analysis is a statistical concept that calculates the average outcome when the future includes scenarios that may or may not happen 
		Decision Tree Example

	Simulation and Modelling

	 Simulations are typically performed using the Monte Carlo technique. In a simulation, the project model is computed many times (iterated), with the input values (e.g., cost estimates or activity durations) chosen at random for each iteration from the probability distributions of these variables.

11.5 Plan Risk Response			

Plan Risk Responses is the process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce threats to project objectives. 

The key benefit of this process is that it addresses the risks by their priority, inserting resources and activities into the budget, schedule and project management plan as needed.



INPUTS

1 Risk management plan
	roles and responsibilities, 
	risk analysis definitions, 
	timing for reviews (and for eliminating risks from review), 
	and risk thresholds for low, moderate, and high risks

2 Risk register

 	identified risks, 
	root causes of risks, 
	lists of potential responses, 
	risk owners, 
	symptoms and warning signs, 
	the relative rating or priority list of project risks, 
	risks requiring responses in the near term, 
	risks for additional analysis and response, 
	trends in qualitative analysis results, 
	and a watch list, 
	which is a list of low-priority risks within the risk register.


FALLBACK PLAN
 A fallback plan can be developed for implementation if the selected strategy turns out not to be fully effective or if an accepted risk occurs.

Secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response

contingency reserve is often allocated for time or cost


Tools and Techniques
.1 Strategies for negative risks or threats

Avoid:
	
project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its impact
involves changing the project management plan to eliminate the threat entirely
Some risks that arise early in the project can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, improving communication, or acquiring expertise

Transfer:
Risk transference is a risk response strategy whereby the project team shifts the impact of a threat to a third party, 
together with ownership of the response.
It does not eliminate.
Transferring does not mean disowning the risk by transferring it to a later project or another person without his or her knowledge or agreement

Mitigate:

Risk mitigation is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to reduce the probability of occurrence or impact of a riskAccept:
Adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable supplier are examples of mitigation actions.

Accept:
Risk acceptance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team decides to acknowledge the risk and not take any action unless the risk occurs
This strategy is adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address a specific risk in any other way
Team descided not to change the PM Plan
active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the risks

.2 Strategies for positive risks or opportunities

Exploit: 

The exploit strategy may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes to ensure that the opportunity is realized.
******EXAMPLE**** Assigning most talented resource to the Project to reduce shcedule overrun.

Enhance. 
The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or the positive impacts of an opportunity. Identifying and maximizing key drivers of these positive-impact risks may increase the probability of their occurrence. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to 
an activity to finish early.

Share. 
Sharing a positive risk involves allocating some or all of the ownership of the opportunity to a third party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures, 
which can be established with the express purpose of taking advantage of the opportunity so that all 
parties gain from their actions.

Accept. Accepting an opportunity is being willing to take advantage of the opportunity if it arises, but 
not actively pursuing it

-Contingency reserves that are calculated based on the quantitative risk analysis of the project and the organization’s risk thresholds.
-Other project documents updated could include:
-Assumptions log updates.  
-technical documentation updates. 
-change requests. Planning for possible risk responses can often result in recommendations for changes 
to the resources, activities, cost estimates, and other items identified during other planning processes. 
When such recommendations are identified, change requests are generated and processed through the 
Perform Integrated Change Control process.

control risks

Control Risks is the process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identified risks, monitoring residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project. 


Benefit
The key benefit of this process is that it improves efficiency of the risk approach throughout the project life cycle to continuously 
optimize risk responses.
