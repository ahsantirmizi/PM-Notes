HOW ORGANIZATION ENVIRONMENT CONTRRIBUTES IN PROJECT RISK.
Risk conditions may include aspects of the project’s or organization’s environment that contribute to project risk, 

such as immature project management practices, 
lack of integrated management systems, 
concurrent multiple projects, or 
dependency on external participants who are outside the project’s direct control.


Known,known: 
	Those risk that has being identified and managed proactively, 
	planned response
Known,unknown: 
	Those risk that has being identified but not managed proactively, 
	there must be contingency reserve for that
Unknow,unknown: 
	Those risk that has not being identified and not managed proactively, 
	there must be Management Reserve

Positive and negative risks are commonly referred to as opportunities and threats respectively

To be successful, an organization should be committed to address risk management proactively and consistently throughout the project

Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is the process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing and combining their probability of occurrence and impact. 

Benefit:
helps in prioritizing risks for further analysis.
helps in identifying probability 
helps in idenfitying impact.

Benefit:
The key benefit of this process is that it enables project managers to reduce the level of uncertainty and to focus on high-priority risks.
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is usually a rapid and cost-effective means of establishing priorities for Plan Risk Responses
The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle

Important point
-it is a Subjective 
-Key participants are expected to be involved to avoid bias and take corrective actions.
-quick
-Cost effective
-Foundation for Quantitative analysis
-Iterative, regularly throughout the life cycle
-Its next process may be Perform Qauntitative or it may move directly to Plan risk response

Tools & Techniques

 .1 Risk probability and impact assessment

		- Basically a process
		- process of assessing the probabilities and consequences of risk events if they are realized. 
		- used to prioritize risks to establish a most-to-least-critical importance ranking. 
		- Ranking risks in terms of their criticality or importance provides 
		- useful for insights to the project's management on where resources may be needed to manage or mitigate the realization of high probability/high consequence risk events.
		- investigates the potential effect on a project objective such as schedule, cost, quality, or performance
		- Risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings
		

 .2 Probability and impact matrix
		- basically a Tool
		- Grid between impact and probability of threat and opportunities
		- helps  in calculating risk score	
		- The risk score helps guide risk responses. 
		- risks that have a negative impact on objectives,  may require priority action and aggressive response strategies.  
		- Low risk scored threats does not require proactive management action 
		- low scored threats are kept in register as part of the watch list or adding a contingency reserve. 
		- Low risk scored Opportunities does not require proactive management action 
		- low scored Opportunities are kept in register as part of the watch list or adding a contingency reserve. 
		- low scored risk should be monitored throughout the project.

 .3 Risk data quality assessment
		- degree to which  the data is useful for the risk management processes.
		- Risk data quality assessment is a technique to evaluate the degree to which the data about risks is useful for risk management. 
		- It involves examining the degree to which the risk is understood and the accuracy, quality, reliability, and integrity of the data about the risk.
		- The use of low-quality risk data may lead to a qualitative risk analysis of little use to the project
		- Its better to get the quality data rather than wasting time and efforts.

 .4 Risk categorization
		- Risk Breakdown structure
		- Categorizes on the basis of sources
		- Categorizes on the basis of areas of project affected
		- Categorizes on the basis of project phases.
		
 .5 Risk urgency assessment
		- basically a process
		- a process of planning a risk response againts most urgent risk.
		- Filtered from the Prioritized list.
		- these risk are expected to be moved directly to plan risk response process.
		- Risks requiring near-term responses may be considered more urgent to address. 
		- Indicators of priority may include 
			-probability of detecting the risk, 
			-time to affect a risk response, 
			-symptoms and warning signs, and 
			-the risk rating.

Tools & Techniques
Data gathering and representation techniques

	Interviewing:
		-Uses experienced resources to gather information
		-Uses historical data to quantify
		-use 3 point estimation
		
	Probability distribution:
		Continous distribution:use in simulation and modeling
			1.Beta 
			2.TRIANGULAR distribution
		Example: how many number of quesitons are between than 3 lines and 4 lines, less than 3 lines, greater than 4 lines in PMP example.
		Discrete distribution
			-Decision tree table
			-useful for calculating the outcome of certain event.
			-Rolling a dice is an example of discrete distribution.
		Uniform distrinution:
			-Rectangular distribution
			-that has constant probability.
			if there is no obvious value that is more likely than any other between specified high and low bounds, such as in 
the early concept stage of design


 .2 Quantitative risk analysis and modeling techniques

	Sensitivity Analysis:
		 
		Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which risks have the most potential impact on the project.
		technique used to determine the effect of uncertainity on different project Objectives 		
		It helps to understand how the variations in project’s objectives correlate with variations in different uncertainties
		Calculates through Tornado diagram 
			-A tornado diagram is a special type of bar chart used in sensitivity analysis
	
	Expected Monetory value
		- statistical concept
		- EVM is a ballpark figure that shows how much money a plaintiff can reasonably expect in mediation
		- Expected monetary value (EMV) analysis is a statistical concept that calculates the average outcome when the future includes scenarios that may or may not happen 
		- Decision Tree Example
		- The EMV of opportunities are generally expressed as positive values
		- The EMV of Threats are generally expressed as negative values

	Simulation and Modelling

		-Simulations are typically performed using the Monte Carlo technique. 
		-In a simulation, the project model is computed many times (iterated), with the input values (e.g., cost estimates or activity durations) chosen at random for each iteration from the probability distributions of these variables.
		-Expressed as Cummulative chart

11.5 Plan Risk Response			

Plan Risk Responses is the process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce threats to project objectives. 

The key benefit of this process is that it addresses the risks by their priority, inserting resources and activities into the budget, schedule and project management plan as needed.



INPUTS

1 Risk management plan
	roles and responsibilities, 
	risk analysis definitions, 
	timing for reviews (and for eliminating risks from review), 
	and risk thresholds for low, moderate, and high risks

2 Risk register

 	identified risks, 
	root causes of risks, 
	lists of potential responses, 
	risk owners, 
	symptoms and warning signs, 
	the relative rating or priority list of project risks, 
	risks requiring responses in the near term, 
	risks for additional analysis and response, 
	trends in qualitative analysis results, 
	and a watch list, 
	which is a list of low-priority risks within the risk register.


FALLBACK PLAN
A fallback plan can be developed for implementation if the selected strategy turns out not to be fully effective or if an accepted risk occurs.

Secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response

contingency reserve is often allocated for time or cost


Tools and Techniques
	Strategies for negative risks or threats

		Avoid:
			-a risk response strategy
			-Usually a good practices
			-project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its impact
			-involves changing the project management plan to eliminate the threat entirely
			-Some risks that arise early in the project can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, improving communication, or acquiring expertise
			-PM may change the project objective that is in jeopardy e.g. chaging scope, extending the scedule, chaning the strategy
			
		Transfer:
			-a risk response strategy
			-shifting the impact of a threat to a third party 
			-together with ownership of the response.
			-It does not eliminate.
			-Transferring does not mean disowning the risk by transferring it to a later project or another person without his or her knowledge or agreement.
			- always involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the risk.
			-Example insurance, performance bonds, warranties, guarantees , procurement related work

		Mitigate:
			-Usually a good practices
			-team acts to reduce the probability of occurrence or impact of a risk
			-Adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable supplier are examples of mitigation actions.
			-Prototyping a model
			_Adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable supplier are examples of mitigation actions
			

		Accept:
			-project team decides to acknowledge the risk and not take any action unless the risk occurs
			-This strategy is adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address a specific risk in any other way
			-Team descided not to change the PM Plan
			-active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the risks
			-Passive strategy is to do not take actions unless it occurs and periodically checks the status .

	Strategies for positive risks or opportunities

		Exploit: (contrast with Avoid)
			-Eliminate the impact of uncertainity
			-ensure that the opportunity is realized
			-The exploit strategy may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes to ensure that the opportunity is realized.
			******EXAMPLE**** Assigning most talented resource to the Project to reduce time to completions
			-New Technology or technology upgrades
			-

		Enhance: (contrast with Mitigation)
			The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or the positive impacts of an opportunity. 
			Identifying and maximizing key drivers of these positive-impact risks may increase the probability of their occurrence. 
			Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to an activity to finish early.

		Share: (contrast with Transference)
			Sharing a positive risk involves allocating some or all of the ownership of the opportunity to a third party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. 
			Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures, 
			which can be established with the express purpose of taking advantage of the opportunity so that all 
			parties gain from their actions.

		Accept: 
			Accepting an opportunity is being willing to take advantage of the opportunity if it arises, but 
			not actively pursuing it


	Contingent response strategies
		-Some responses are designed for use only if certain events occur.
		-response plan that will only be executed under certain predefined conditions
