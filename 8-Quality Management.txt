Quality
The degree to which the project fulfills requirements(All types of requirements).

Quality Management

Project Quality Management includes the processes and activities of the performing organization that determine 
quality policies, objectives, and responsibilities so that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken.



-The quality is achieved when project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken.
-It helps policies and procedures to implement, within the project’s context.
-it supports continuous process improvement for activities and Processes.
-Addresses the management of the project and the deliverables of the project.
-Quality measures and techniques are specific to the type of deliverables being produced by the project

-Meeting customer Requirements using Late sitting / overworking may
-Decreased profit
-Increase Risk
-Employee Attrition
-Errors Rework

-Meeting project schedule objectives by rushing planned quality inspections may
-Decreased profit
-Increase Post implementation Risks

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Quality:the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfill requirements

Grade as a design intent is a category or classification assigned to deliverables having the same functional use but different technical characteristics
**************************************************************************************************************************************************************** 



Quality of a product does not depand on GRADE.

A product of high grade can have low quality (appropriate for general Purpose)
A Product of Low quality can have high Grade (Infficient / Infeffective)


Precision:
measure of exactness, 
little scattered, with minimum deviation

Accuracy
assessment of correctness.
example standard page load time is 1sec, the web page is attempting to get loaded in 1.1 sec



- Lack of Quality-> increases in Risks-> Rework / failure repair ->Scope Creep-> Schedule Overruns-> Cost overruns



PLAN QUALITY MANAGEMENT

Plan Quality Management is the process of identifying quality requirements and/or standards for the project and 
its deliverables, and documenting how the project will demonstrate compliance with relevant quality requirements

-Performed parallel with other plans
-Iterative

*****************************************************************Quality theorists***********************************************************************************



Joseph Juran
	"FITNESS FOR USE"
	-80/20
	-"Fitness for use" is a Quality 

W.Edwards Deming 
	"CUSTOMER SATISFICATION"
	-14 points to QM
	-Plan Do Check Act "PDCA" is a Quality
	-continous improvement

Philip Corsby
	-"CONFORMANCE TO REQUIREMENTS"->"CUSTOMER SATISFICATION"+"FITNESS FOR USE"
	-Emphasizes "Preventation over Inspection"
	-"Zero Defects"
	-Cost of poor Quality



*********************************************************List of Actions required to get ensured  ***************************************************************


- Review Project Management Plan specially Scope baseline, Schedule baseline & Cost Baseline.
- Identify the Standards, Procedures
- Identify Quality requirement
- Identify the change of Impact on Quality
- Identify Documentation and Lesson learned
- Identify Project Management Activities.
- Understand Customer's Quality definition
- Understand Requirements.
- Identify Quality Metrics
- Identify level of Quality
- Identify list of processes that are going to implemented
- Plan how to improve the processes.
- Measure performance against standards. 

*******************************************************************Cost of Quality****************************************************************

Cost of Conformance
	-Preventive Cost
		-Traning
		-Documentation
	-Appraisal Cost
		-Testing
		-Inspection
		-Destructive Testing Loss
Cost of Non Conformance
	-Internal Failure
		-Rework
		-Scrap
	-External Failure 
		-Lost business 
		-Liabilities
		-Warrant work

****************************************************************************************************************************************************************

1 Inputs
 .1 Project management plan
	-Scope Baseline.
		-Project Scope statement
		-WBS 
		-Wbs Dictionary	
	-Schedule Baseline
		-schedule performance measures, 
		-including start and finish dates
	-Cost baseline
		-accepted time interval being used to measure cost performance
	-Other Management Plans		 	
 .2 Stakeholder register
	-Which stakeholder can/may impact  the quality of the product.
 .3 Risk register
	-Which threats or opportunities might impact the qualities
 .4 Requirements documentation
	-What are the Business requirements,Stakeholder requirements, transition requirements, solution requirements (Functional and Non Functional), project requirements
 .5 Enterprise environmental factors
	-Governmental agency regulations
	-Working conditions
	-Cultural perception about quality
 .6 Organizational process assets
	-

2 Tools & Techniques
 .1 Cost-benefit analysis
	-It is a selection method.
	-What activities are needed to be selected for which the maximum benefit/revenue the project that take out of that.
	-Less work higher productivity. 
	-Higher the BCR, higher the chances of selection of the project
	-Lower the BCR, higher the chances of termination of the project
 .2 Cost of quality
	-Cost of Non confirmance
		-Money spent during and after project due  to failures
	-Cost of confirmance
		--Money spent during project to avoid failures.
 .3 Seven basic quality tools
	-Control charts
		- Used for checking the process stability or for controlling 
		- Rule of seven, heutirtic, thumb rule.
		- Upper and lower limits are identified as levels.
		- seven **consecutive** point above or below the mean referred as OUT OF CONTROL process else IN CONTROL
		- Above the upper limit and Below the lower limit refer as OUT OF CONTROL process else IN CONTROL.
		- For out of control process Special cause / assignable cause is recommended as preventive action.
	-Flow charts
		- Process Maps
		- Branching. decision, parallel processing
		- Often used in understanding and estimating the COST OF QUALITY
	-Check Sheets
		- Tally sheets
		- Used for collecting data related to the attribute.
		- used in inspection to identify the defects.
	-Scatter digram
		- Relation between variables.
		- Correlation Chart
		- Used in estimating and scheduling
		- Relation between depedant and independent variables.
		- obtain Regression and Trend line if correlation exist
	-Parento Chart
		- 80/20
		- Veritical bar chart
		- Identify few sources Which causes most of the problems
		- prioritized list of Problems.
		- Left to right (High to low)
	-Cause effect diagram
		- Ishikawa / Fishbone
		- Problem are placed at bone and try to identify the Root causes
		- Often used as preventative meaasure
	-Histograms
		- Bar chart
		- SHow statistical distribution
		- Data dispersion e.g Resource histogram (amount of time that a resource is scheduled to work over a series).
		- Also used to identify Scehdule and Cost variances and frequency of scope changes.
 .4 Benchmarking
		- Compare the performance of the project in development with the past project 
		- With in or outside the organization

 .5 Design of experiments
		- identify which combination of variables are important for improving the process.
		- Fast 
		- Accurate
		- E.g particular combination of Paint, matrerial, locks, chip and  joints can create best quality door
		- Reduces sensitivity
 .6 Statistical sampling
		- Staistically measure the quality of the product of the project
		- Take a sample and inspect it.
		- measuring the size of 10,000 doors might take too long except using Statistical sampling.
		- Time taking
		- Cost risk.
		
 .7 Additional quality planning tools
		- Brain storming: Idea generating or requirement collection tecnhique in a group
		- Force field Analysis: These are diagram for and against change
		- Nominal Group:Ideas generated by lot of groups, then idea fo group with the larger no will be accepted.
