Pay back period:the length of time required for an investment to recover its initial outlay in 
terms of profits or savings

Internal rate of return (IRR) is a metric used in capital budgeting measuring the profitability 
of potential investments Internal rate of return is a discount rate that makes the net present 
value (NPV) of all cash flows from a particular project equal to zero

ROI is usually expressed as a percentage and is typically used for personal financial decisions, 
to compare a company's profitability or to compare the efficiency of different investments The 
return on investment formula is: ROI = (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) x 100

NET PRESENT VALUE, the value in the present of a sum of money, in contrast to some future value 
it will have when it has been invested at compound interest

Project Manager should consider stakeholder requirements for managing and planning cost.

Estimate Cost
Estimate Costs is the process of developing an approximation of the monetary resources needed to complete project activities	

Types of Estimates:

"The different types of estimates are:
	-Definitive: - 5% to +10% accuracy
	-Budgetary: -10% to +25% accuracy
	-Order of magnitude: - 25% to +75% accuracy
So, if -5% to +10% variation is allowable, only 29 - 31 days fits that criterion.

Type of costs:
	-Fixed cost:
		- Change with the amount of production, amount of work
		- Cost of Matrial, Supplies & wages
	-Variable cost
		- Does not get changed when product gets changed
		- Rent, utilities, cost of set up.
	-Direct cost 
		- Directly attributaable to the work of the project
		- Team travel, Team Wages, recognition, cost of material used on the project
	-Indirect Cost:
		- utility bills (Mobile, gas, light, water, sanitation),janitorial services,taxes, fringe benefit 


BENEFIT:
The key benefit of this process is that it determines the amount of cost required to complete project work

Cost aggregation
	Step:1 Sum of cost of acitivities are rolled up to Work packages
	Step:2 Sum of cost Work packages are rolled up to Control accounts
	Step:3 Sum of cost Control accounts are rolled up to Project Costing
	
	NOTE: Step 1,2,3 is cost aggregating
Cost Baseline= contigency reserves + Project Cost
Budget = Management reserve + Cost baseline.

Control Costs is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project costs and managing 
changes to the cost baseline. 

BENEFIT
The key benefit of this process is that it provides the means to recognize variance from the plan in order to take corrective action and minimize risk	
	
Project cost control includes:
•	 Influencing the factors that create changes to the authorized cost baseline;
•	 Ensuring that all change requests are acted on in a timely manner;
•	 Managing the actual changes when and as they occur;
•	 Ensuring that cost expenditures do not exceed the authorized funding by period, by WBS component, by activity, and in total for the project;
•	 Monitoring cost performance to isolate and understand variances from the approved cost baseline;
•	 Monitoring work performance against funds expended;
•	 Preventing unapproved changes from being included in the reported cost or resource usage;
•	 Informing appropriate stakeholders of all approved changes and associated cost; and
•	 Bringing expected cost overruns within acceptable limits

.2 Tools & Techniques
.1 Earned value management
		- Planned PV:
			- Authorized budget assigned to scheduled (Not included Management reserves)
			- performance measurement baseline (PMB)
					
		- Earned Value EV:
			- measure of work performed expressed
			- budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed
			- EV measured cannot be greater than the authorized PV budget for a component
			- useful for measuring the project measurement.
	
		- Actual Value AC:
			- realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a specific time period
			- total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured
		
		- Schedule Variance:
			- SV=EV-PV (interms of Planned Work)
			- SV>1 means project is ahead. (e.g. 20 din me 40 kursiyan banani thee, 5 din bad 4 kursiyan banayeen, kya SV ho ga)
			- SV<1 means project is behind.
			- SV<0 means project is on time.
			
		- Cost Variance:
			- CV=EV-AC (interms of Cost, directly cost)
			- CV>1 means project is under budget.
			- CV<1 means project is overbudget
			- CV=0 means on budget.
		
		- Schedule performance index
			- measure of schedule efficiency
			- EV/PV
			- SPI > 1 project is ahead (More work done in less time)
			- SPI < 1 project is behind (less work done in more time)
			- SPI = 1 Project is on time.
		
		- Cost performance index
			- measure of cost efficiency
			- EV/AC
			- CPI > 1 project is ahead (More work done in less time)
			- CPI < 1 project is behind (less work done in more time)
			- CPI = 1 Project is on time.
