whether they are internal (at all organizational levels) or external to the organization. 
Effective communication creates a bridge between diverse stakeholders who may have different cultural and organizational backgrounds, different levels of expertise, and different perspectives and interests, which impact or 
have an influence upon the project execution or outcome.

10.1   Plan  communications Management—The process of developing an appropriate approach and plan for project communications based on stakeholder’s information needs and requirements, and 
available organizational assets.

Inadequate communications planning may lead to problems such as 
delay in message delivery, 
communication of information to the wrong audience, or 
insufficient communication to the stakeholders and 
misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the message communicated.



Effective communication means that the information is provided in the 
-right format, 
-at the right time, 
-to the right audience, and 
-with the right impact. 



Efficient communication means providing only the information that is needed.


-Who needs what information, and who is authorized to access that information;
-When they will need the information;
-Where the information should be stored;
-What format the information should be stored in;
-How the information can be retrieved; and
-Whether time zone, language barriers, and cross-cultural considerations need to be taken into account.

Inputs

Project management plan
The project management plan provides information on how the project will be executed, monitored, controlled, and closed
	
Stakeholder register
The stakeholder register provides the information needed to plan the communication with project stakeholders.

.2 Tools & Techniques
 .1 Communication requirements analysis


The analysis of the communication requirements determines the information needs of the project stakeholders. 
-type and format of information
-number of potential communication channels or paths  n(n-1)/2 (n is number of stakeholders)


Source where communication requirements can be taken

-Organizational charts;
-Project organization and stakeholder responsibility relationships;
-Disciplines, departments, and specialties involved in the project;
-Logistics of how many persons will be involved with the project and at which locations;
-Internal information needs (e.g., when communicating within organizations);
-External information needs (e.g., when communicating with the media, public, or contractors); and
-Stakeholder information and communication requirements from within the stakeholder register 



 .2 Communication technology




what technology is required for tranforming project information among the stake holder

Factors That can affect the choice of information

urgency of the need for information.  
-urgency, 
-frequency, and 
format of the information to be communicated.

Availability of technology. 
-technology is compatible, 
-available, and 
-accessible for all stakeholders throughout the life of the project.

Ease of use:
- Easily adoptable
- Suitable for Project members


Project Environement:
-Team work at a same location/ or disperse location
-Team work Face to face or not
-Language is same or different.
-Cultural difference

Sensitivity and confidentiality of the information.

- Whether information is confidential or sensitive
- Additional security measure needs to take or not




 .3 Communication models



-Encode. Thoughts or ideas are translated (encoded) into language by the sender.
-transmit Message. This information is then sent by the sender using communication channel (medium). 
The transmission of this message may be compromised by various factors (e.g., distance, unfamiliar 
technology, inadequate infrastructure, cultural difference, and lack of background information). These 
factors are collectively termed as noise.
-decode. The message is translated by the receiver back into meaningful thoughts or ideas.
-Acknowledge. Upon receipt of a message, the receiver may signal (acknowledge) receipt of the message 
but this does not necessarily mean agreement with or comprehension of the message.
-Feedback/response. When the received message has been decoded and understood, the receiver 
encodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this message to the original sender.

 .4 Communication methods

Interactive communication. Between two or more parties performing a multidirectional exchange 
of information. It is the most efficient way to ensure a common understanding by all participants on 
specified topics, and includes meetings, phone calls, instant messaging, video conferencing, etc.

Push communication. Sent to specific recipients who need to receive the information. This ensures 
that the information is distributed but does not ensure that it actually reached or was understood by the 
intended audience. Push communications include letters, memos, reports, emails, faxes, voice mails, 
blogs, press releases, etc.

Pull communication. Used for very large volumes of information, or for very large audiences, and 
requires the recipients to access the communication content at their own discretion. These methods 
include intranet sites, e-learning, lessons learned databases, knowledge repositories, etc.

10.2   Manage communications—The process of creating, collecting, distributing, storing, retrieving and the ultimate disposition of project information in accordance with the communications management 
plan.


10.3  control communications—The process of monitoring and controlling communications throughout the entire project life cycle to ensure the information needs of the project stakeholders are met.
These processes interact with each other and with processes in other Knowledge Areas as described in detail in Section 3 and Annex A1.
