.2 Tools & Techniques

1 Organization charts and position descriptions

-document team member roles and responsibilities & reporting relation
-Three formats hierarchical (high-level roles), matrix, and text-oriented(detailed responsibilities)
-the objective is to ensure that each work package has an unambiguous owner
-all team members have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities

Hierarchial Charts:

-show positions and 
-relationships in a graphical, top-down format.
-WBS provides the decompotion of project deliverables, on which the resources will be assigned and responsible
-OBS (Organization Breakdown Structure) Teams, Departments, Units. Work packages will be assigned under the OBS.
-RBS (Resource Break Down Structure) hierarchial break down of resource by type and category.
-The RBS is helpful in tracking project costs and can be aligned with the organization’s accounting system.


Matrix-based charts:

-Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM)
-(RAM) is a grid that shows the project resources assigned to each work package.
-It is used to illustrate the connections between work packages or activities and project team members
-high-level RAM can define what a project team group or unit is responsible for within each component of the WBS
-lower-level RAMs are used within the group to designate roles, responsibilities, and levels of authority for specific activities.
-shows all activities associated with one person and all people associated with one activity.
-This also ensures that there is only one person accountable for any one task to avoid confusion of responsibility
-RACI (responsible, accountable, consult, and inform).
-A RACI chart is a useful tool to use when the team consists of internal and external resources

Text-oriented formats:

-detailed descriptions of team member responsibilities.
-Document mentions responsibilities, authority, competencies, and qualifications associated with the team member.

- Oftenly provided by EEF.

4 Expert judgment

-List the preliminary requirements for the required skills;
-Assess the roles required for the project based on standardized role descriptions within the organization;
-Determine the preliminary effort level and number of resources needed to meet project objectives;
-Determine reporting relationships needed based on the organizational culture;
-Provide guidelines on lead time required for staffing, based on lessons learned and market conditions;
-Identify risks associated with staff acquisition, retention, and release plans; and
-Identify and recommend programs for complying with applicable government and union contracts.

Tools and Technique

Pre-Assignments

When project team members are selected in advance, they are considered pre-assigned. 
This situation can occur if the project is the result of specific people being identified as part of a competitive proposal
if the project is dependent upon the expertise of particular persons, or 
if some staff assignments are defined within the project charter.

Acquisition
When the performing organization is unable to provide the staff needed to complete a project, the required 
services may be acquired from outside sources. This can involve hiring individual consultants or subcontracting 
work to another organization


Develop Project Team


Project managers should acquire skills to identify, build, maintain, motivate, lead, and inspire project teams 
to achieve high team performance and to meet the project’s objectives. 
Teamwork is a critical factor for project 
success, and developing effective project teams is one of the primary responsibilities of the project manager. 
Project managers should create an environment that facilitates teamwork. Project managers should continually 
motivate their team by providing challenges and opportunities, by providing timely feedback and support as 
needed, and by recognizing and rewarding good performance. High team performance can be achieved by using 
open and effective communication, creating team building opportunities, developing trust among team members, 
managing conflicts in a constructive manner, and encouraging collaborative problem solving and decision making. 
The project manager should request management support and/or influence the appropriate stakeholders to acquire 
the resources needed to develop effective project teams.
Project managers operate in a global environment and work on projects characterized by cultural diversity. Team 
members often have diverse industry experience, know multiple languages, and sometimes operate in the “team 
language” that may be a different language or norm than their native one. The project management team should 
capitalize on cultural differences, focus on developing and sustaining the project team throughout the project life 
cycle, and promote working together interdependently in a climate of mutual trust. Developing the project team 
improves the people skills, technical competencies, and overall team environment and project performance. It 
requires clear, timely, effective, and efficient communication between team members throughout the life of the 
project. Objectives of developing a project team include, but are not limited to
