Important Point

- understanding the impact of cultural influences is critical in projects involving diverse organizations and locations around the world
- project managers in distant locations are able to more effectively communicate with all relevant stakeholders within the organizational structure to 
facilitate decision making

Organization structure

Functional
	-Functional Manager is a department Head
	-One clear superior to team member
	-Resource availability is  little of none for PM
	-PM authority is little or none
	-Grouped by speciality
	-Idependent work
	-FM will conduct budget
	-For a critical project PROJECTIZED TEAM may be created in Function organization

Matrix
reflect a blend of functional and projectized characteristics.
	-Weak Matrix
		-PM authority is low
		-FM authority is high
		-Resorce availability is low
		-FM will conduct budget
		-PM is Expiditor or Co ordinator
		-Expiditor cannot make decision
		-Co ordinator has some power to make decision
		-Report to high level manager
	-Balanced Matrix 
		-PM authority is Moderate
		-FM authority is Moderate
		-Resource availability is Moderate
		-MIXED will conduct budget
	-Strong Matrix

Stakeholder Classification

	-Negative
	-Performing
	-Advising

Stakeholder Engagement Level
	-Nuetral
	-Supportive
	-Unaware
	-Leading
	-Resisting

Identification of Stakeholders
	-continuous process throughout the entire project life cycle
	-Critical for the project success
	-Can cause delays which cause schedule overrun which causes cost overrun
	-Example legal department is a significant stakeholder.

Useful for
	-Requirement Identification
	-Identy communication channels
	-Risk identification
	-Identification of Stakeholder expectations
	-Identification of Stakeholder engagement levels

Project Stakeholders
	-Team members and external entities
	- Project Team 
		-Sponsor 
		-Project Management Team+
		-Project manager+
		-Other Team members
	
	- Project Stakeholders 
		-Project Team
		-Customer/End user
		-Operations
		-Functional Manager
		-Sellers
		-Business Partners
		-PMO
		-Program Manager 
		-Portfolio Manager

Project Governance
	-Alignment the projects with business strategy 
	-framework in which the project manager and sponsors can make decisions 
	-satisfy stakeholder needs and 
	-satisfy stakeholder expectations 
	-Satisfy organizational strategic objectives
	-Encompasses the Project life cycle
	-Provides Frame work for Managing the projects, for project success, for aligning the project objective with the organization strategy
	-Responsibles are portfolio manager, program manager, or organization sponsoring entity

Framework of Project Governance
•	 Project success and deliverable acceptance criteria;
•	 Process to identify, escalate, and resolve issues that arise during the project;
•	 Relationship among the project team, organizational groups, and external stakeholders;
•	 Project organization chart that identifies project roles;
•	 Processes and procedures for the communication of information;
•	 Project decision-making processes;
•	 Guidelines for aligning project governance and organizational strategy;
•	 Project life cycle approach;
•	 Process for stage gate or phase reviews;
•	 Process for review and approval for changes to budget, scope, quality, and schedule which are beyond the authority of the project manager; and
•	 Process to align internal stakeholders with project process requirements.
	

SUccess of Project
	-Completing the project with in below mentioned constraint
		1.Scope, 
		2.Time, 
		3.Cost, 
		4.Quality, 
		5.Resources, 
		6.Risk
	-PM is accountable for setting realistic
	
Basic Project Teams Composition

	- Part time
		- Functional Manager is a king
		- No Control for PM
		- Team member works in multiple teams
		- Matrix, Functional
	- Dedicated
		- All or majority project Team members are assigned
		- Usually report to the project manager
		- Team may be colocated or virtual
		- Simplest structure for project Manager
		- Projectized

Project Life Cycle
	-series of phases 
	-from its initiation to its closure
	-Sequential
	-Phases are generally time bounded
	-Provides basic framework for managing project irrespective of work.

Types of Project life Cycle:
	-Predictive
		- Fully plan driven (scope is well defined)
		- Deliverables and processes are well defined at the beginning of the Project
		- distinct work in each phases
		- require different skill set in team.
		- Team focuses on plaining the scope, scedule and cost from the start as soon as possible
		- Preventing scope changes, but if happens, replaning occurs and change control is there.
		- Rolling wave planing may occurs.
		
	-Adaptive
		- Change driven 
		- Also iterative and incremental
		- sprints
		- The product is developed over multiple iterations and detailed scope is defined for each iteration only as the iteration begins.
		- Useful in rapid change environment
	-Iterative/Incremental
		- iterations
		- Iterations in Project activies
		- increments in product functionality
		- High level vision is given for 1st iteration, then iteratively developed
		- Administrative closure will be done at the end of each Iteration.
		- Useful when partial delivery of the product is beneficial
		


Project life cycle Characteristics 

- Cost is low in the start
- Staffing is low in the start
- Cost is high in the execution
- Staffing is high in the execution
- Risk is high in the start/initiation (decreases as decision are made/ deliverables)
- Risk is low in the closure
- ability to influence the final characteristics of the project’s product highest in the start
- ability to influence the final characteristics of the project’s product get decreases as project progresses

Project Phases

	-collection of logically related project activities that produces deliverable
	-Its results in deliverable
	-in general Executed sequentially, but can be overlapped
	-Might have different durations
	-Closure of the Phase results in hand off the deliverable with formal acceptance	
	-Can terminate at phase end (Stage gate,Milestone,kill point)


Phase to Phase relationship
	-Sequential Relationship
		-Step by step
		-Finsih to Start
		-reduces uncertainity
		-Low chances for Schedule reduction
	-Overlapping Relationship
		-Fast Tracking
		-Phase starts prior to completion of the one.
		-High uncertainity
		-Might reduce the schedule.
		-Example Building a new factory.
