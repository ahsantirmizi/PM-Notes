<-----------------------------------------LIfe Cycle--------------------------------------------->


Project Life Cycle

1. Life cycle
- Start 
- Middle phases with evolution
- End
- Deliverables/ results are predictive

Chapter 3-Project life cycle

- Start of project
- Middle phases with evolution project
- End of project

->depand on the nature of the project, it may have different number of steps SOftware project life cycle might have different phases while construction project life cycle might have different life cycle.
->Can be parallel or serial.

Project life cycle types
-Preditctive-WaterFall
*plan driven
*Big Effort up front
*Deliverables are predictive
*Scope is freezed

-Adaptive-Agile,Iterative
*short iteration
*evolution of FB
*evoluaiton of Orkut
*Scope is not freezed

<----------------------------------------Functional Organization Structure------------------------------------->
Advantage
The communication is at functional level (departmental level)
Every department has his/her head
