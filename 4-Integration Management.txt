Develop project Charter:
Develop Project Charter is the process of developing a document that formally authorizes the existence of a 
project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. 

Important Point

- It is not a detailed.
- Not much money and Time needs to invest.
- Developing Organization needs to Meet with the key stakeholders of the organization who is willing to get develop.
- It is to assess the feasiblity of project. 
- Sponsor authorizes the project.
- PM may create project charter, but sponsor will authorizing the PC.
-

Content:
- High level Requirement
- High level project description.
- Business case
- High level Scope WBS.
- High level Cost
- High level Risk
- High level stakeholders. 
- High level team resources.
- High level Constraint, assumptions & objectives.
- Project Manager Assignement and Authorition level.(does project Manager authorized to change buget, to select Team)
- Project Approval requirements.

Difference between smaller and Larger project

- Complex communication channel
- more cultures, languages, timings.
- Complex network diagram due to large  number of Activities.
- More risk
- Larger stakeholder group and difficult to manage w.r.t their power/interest.
- Require formal Change management process.
- Involve multiple contract.
- Experiences and specialists resources, that are expensive i.e risk manager may be required for managing detailed risks in larger projects.

if company's strategic goal is to Enter into a NEW AREA OF BUSINESS, but Cost is a Constraint, then Project Manager must asked for sponsor to increase the budget 
rather than cutitng cost . All what project manager needs to do is to Analyse the stragic goal in the Business case document i.e. business need.

Monitor and Control Project Work is the process of tracking, reviewing, and reporting the progress to meet the 
performance objectives defined in the project management plan

Benefit
The key benefit of this process is that it allows stakeholders to understand the current state of the project, the steps taken, and budget, schedule, and scope 
forecasts

INPORTANT ACTIVITIES

1.Perform throughout the project life cycle.
2.involves collection data generated from different processes(WPI-work performance information)
	- CONTROL SCOPE
		- Compare the performance of the project scope and product scope vs scope baseline.
		- observing scope creeping.
		- observe whether all change requests are processed through  PICC.
	- CONTROL SCEDULE
		- Compare the performance of the Schedule vs scope baseline.
		- Forecasted Schedule.
	- CONTROL COST
		- Compare the performance of the cost vs scope baseline.
		- Earned Value Management
		- Forecasted cost
	- PERFORM QUALITY ASSURANCE
		- Whether a process is correctly executed or not.
		- Auditing a process to check the stability.
	- CONTROL QUALITY
		- Any non confirmance to the product or project.
		- whether product is upto the Quality standards.
	- MANAGE PROJECT TEAM
		- tracking team member performance, providing feedback, resolving issues, and managing changes to optimize project performance

	- CONTROL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
		- project stakeholder relationships and 
		- adjusting strategies and 
		- plans for engaging stakeholders.
		
3.involves continous improvement
4.involves identification of variances with the baselines

Perform Integrated Change Control is the process of reviewing all change requests; approving changes and 
managing changes to deliverables, organizational process assets, project documents, and the project management 
plan; and communicating their disposition, approves or rejects the changes.

Benefits	
	
1. documented changes
2. reducing risk.
3. Impact Analysis.

Important point:

1. its better to prevent change, rather than changing, trying to find out the root cause that can cause a change
2. if changes are required, better to change in the early stages rather than on later stages
3. changes can have negative or positive impact, not always bad.
4. changes may be arised by sponsor , customer or project manager him/herself
5. Exessive change can cause impossible for PM to co ordinate the work. 
6. As per PMI, all projects must have CCB change control board (Formally charttered group).
7. Change control board possess experts and reduce technical depandency.
8. Change control board is responsible for approving, posponing and rejecting changes.
9. CCB may contain customer, expert, project sponsor, project Manager, functional Manager
10.in case of approval or rejection, PM documents the CCB's decision in Change log.
11.in case of Approval, the approved requests are executed through DIRECT AND MANAGE PROJECT WORK.
12.Get customer buy in. 

HOW TO CONTROL CHANGES:
1. Conduct proper use of Identify stakeholder to uncover requirements
2. Spend enough time on proper risk management.
3. Proper plan for cost and time reserves
4. have a process of change control
5. Follow the change control process
6. have a change requests templates
7. Have clear roles and responsibilities for approved or reject changes
8. Re-evaluate the business case if excessive number of changes 
9. consider terminating the project if too many excessive changes occurs and initiate a new project with more complete requirement
10. allow only approved changes to the baselines.

General Steps for handling the change request:
-Prevent the root cause of change
-Identify change
-look at the impact of the change with in the knowledge area
-Create a change request
-PICC
	-Assess the change: 
		check whether change lie with in project charter, if not initiate another project.
		if change is beneficial to the existing project? if not, then reject the change.
		
	-Look for option
	-Change is approved or rejected
	-Update the status of change request in the change log 
		Reasons for rejection should be documented.
	-update plans and  documents
	 e.g a change in scope can cause update in WBS, WBS dictionary, Scope baseline, activity list, HRM, Stakeholder register, risk register.
	
-Manage stake holder expectation by communicating the change log to stakeholder that are affected by change.
-Manage the project.

-Configuration management activities in PICC
	-Configuration management is focused on specifying deliverables and processes.
		- configuration identification.
			-Labeling of items
			-Accountibility is maintained.
		- configuration status accounting. 
			-Status of proposed changes
			-who authorize the change
			-what time
			-number of changes
		- configuration verification and audit.
			-

Example:	
 -particular change to scope can create an impact to below mentioned project constraint
  1.time
  2.cost
  3.Risk
  4.resources
  5.Customer satifaction.
